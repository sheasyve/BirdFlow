## Extensions can be built, validated & installed via command-line.

#### To build the package defined in the current directory use the following commands:
``` bash
blender --command extension build
```
#### See build docs.

## To validate the manifest without building the package:
``` bash
blender --command extension validate
```
## You may also validate a package without having to extract it first.
```bash
blender --command extension validate add-on-package.zip
```
